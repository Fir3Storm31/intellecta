# Infinity & Infinitesimal

### Limit

A limit is the value that a function (or sequence) approaches as the input (or index) approaches some value.

Formally, suppose a1, a2, … is a sequence of real numbers. When the limit of the sequence exists, the real number L is the limit of this sequence if and only if for every real number ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all \(n > N\), we have \(|a_{n} − L| < \varepsilon \).

The common notation 
$$L=\lim_{n \to \infty}a_{n}$$
