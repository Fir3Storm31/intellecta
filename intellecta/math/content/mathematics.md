The word mathematics comes from Ancient Greek máthēma (μάθημα), meaning "that which is learnt", "what one gets to know". (From wikipedia)

These topics are represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory, algebra, geometry, and analysis, respectively.

A mathematical object is any concept that has been, or could be, formally defined, and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Commonly encountered mathematical objects include numbers, sets, functions, expressions, geometric objects, transformations of other mathematical objects, and spaces.
