### Derivative

The derivative is a fundamental tool of calculus that quantifies the sensitivity of change of a function's output with respect to its input.

A function of a real variable f(x) is differentiable at a point a of its domain, if its domain contains an open interval containing a, and the limit
L=lim_h->0 f(a+h)-f(a)/h
exists. Then L is the derivative of f(x) in a, also denoted as f'(a).
