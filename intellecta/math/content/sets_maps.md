Not everything is itself, and something has to be something else. This is the philosophical idea behind the construction of a collection. Since different things exist, they can be collected or not, and therefore, we can construct a collection. A set is then defined to be a well-defined collection of distinct mathematical objects.

Sets emerge as fundamental building blocks, forming the bedrock upon which almost any mathematical structures are erected.

A set can contain no objects. In that case, it is called the ==empty set==, or can contain a certain amount of distinct objects.

But we know that to be considered an "object," a set has to be formally defined. To do so, we give the object "set" a series of properties to make it formal and deprived of contradictions or paradoxes. These are the Frankel-Zermelo axioms, which are as follows:

1. **Axiom of extensionality**
Two sets are equal if they have the same elements.

2. **Axiom of regularity**
Every non-empty set x contains a member y such that x and y are disjoint sets.

3. **Axiom schema of specification**
Subsets are commonly constructed using set builder notation. 

4. **Axiom of pairing**
If x and y are sets, then there exists a set which contains x and y as elements, for example if x = {1,2} and y = {2,3} then z will be {{1,2},{2,3}}

5. **Axiom of union**
The union over the elements of a set exists. For example, the union over the elements of the set {{1,2},{2,3}} is {1,2,3}

6. **Axiom schema of replacement**
The axiom schema of replacement asserts that the image of a set under any definable function will also fall inside a set.

7. **Axiom of infinity**
More colloquially, there exists a set X having infinitely many members. 

8. **Axiom of power set**
The Axiom of power set states that for any set x, there is a set y that contains every subset of x.

A set is defined by its elements, which can be anything from numbers and letters to more abstract entities. We denote a set by curly braces, and its elements are listed within. For example, the set of natural numbers less than 5 can be expressed as {1, 2, 3, 4}.

**Set Operations: Building Complexity**

Sets interact through operations that manipulate their elements, providing a means to create new sets or analyze relationships. Union, intersection, and complement are fundamental operations. The union of two sets, A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, comprises all elements that belong to A, B, or both. On the other hand, the intersection, A ∩ B, consists of elements common to both sets.

**Set Notation: A Language of Precision**

Mathematics employs rigorous notation to articulate ideas precisely. Symbols like ∈ (element of), ⊆ (subset), and ∅ (empty set) convey intricate relationships within sets. The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), encompasses all possible subsets of A, including A itself and the empty set.

**Set Cardinality: Counting Elements**

The cardinality of a set refers to the number of elements it contains. Finite sets have a clear cardinality, while infinite sets, such as the set of natural numbers, exhibit a countably infinite cardinality. The concept of cardinality allows mathematicians to classify sets based on their "size" or abundance.

**Set Theory: A Framework for Mathematics**

Developed by Georg Cantor in the late 19th century, set theory forms the bedrock of modern mathematics. It delves into the nature of sets, exploring infinite sets, ordinals, and cardinals. The Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, with the axiom of choice (ZFC), establishes a rigorous foundation for most of mathematics.

**Applications: Beyond the Abstract**

While sets find their roots in abstract mathematical realms, their applications extend far beyond. Computer science, for instance, leverages set theory in algorithms and data structures. Set theory also serves as the basis for probability theory, a crucial tool in fields like statistics and finance.

**Conclusion: Sets as Mathematical Cornerstones**

In conclusion, sets emerge as fundamental entities in mathematics, providing a framework for precise reasoning and analysis. Their abstract nature belies their ubiquity, reaching into diverse branches of mathematics and beyond. As we navigate the intricacies of mathematical landscapes, understanding sets unravels a tapestry that binds various mathematical concepts in a harmonious structure.

## Maps

A map assigns to the element of a set X one or multiple elements of a set Y, where X and Y are generic sets.
