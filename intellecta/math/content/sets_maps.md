### Sets

Not everything is itself, and something has to be something else. This is the philosophical idea behind the construction of a collection. Since different things exist, they can be collected or not, and therefore, we can construct a collection. A set is then defined to be a well-defined collection of distinct mathematical objects.

Sets emerge as fundamental building blocks, forming the bedrock upon which almost any mathematical structures are erected.

A set can contain no objects. In that case, it is called the empty set, or can contain a certain amount of distinct objects.

But we know that to be considered an "object," a set has to be formally defined. To do so, we give the object "set" a series of properties to make it formal and deprived of contradictions or paradoxes. These are the Frankael-Zermelo axioms, which are as follows:

1. **Axiom of extensionality**
Two sets are equal if they have the same elements. 

2. **Axiom of regularity**
Every non-empty set x contains a member y such that x and y are disjoint sets.

3. **Axiom schema of specification**
Subsets are commonly constructed using set builder notation. 

4. **Axiom of pairing**
If x and y are sets, then there exists a set which contains x and y as elements, for example if x = {1,2} and y = {2,3} then z will be {{1,2},{2,3}}

5. **Axiom of union**
The union over the elements of a set exists. For example, the union over the elements of the set {{1,2},{2,3}} is {1,2,3}

6. **Axiom schema of replacement**
The axiom schema of replacement asserts that the image of a set under any definable function will also fall inside a set.

7. **Axiom of infinity**
More colloquially, there exists a set X having infinitely many members. 

8. **Axiom of power set**
The Axiom of power set states that for any set x, there is a set y that contains every subset of x.

### Maps

What is a map expert
## Maps

A map assigns to the element of a set X one or multiple elements of a set Y, where X and Y are generic sets.
