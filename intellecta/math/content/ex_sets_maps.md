Sets emerge as fundamental building blocks, forming the bedrock upon which almost any mathematical structures are erected.

A set can contain no objects. In that case, it is called the empty set, or can contain a certain amount of distinct objects.

But we know that to be considered an "object," a set has to be formally defined. To do so, we give the object "set" a series of properties to make it formal and deprived of contradictions or paradoxes. These are the Frankel-Zermelo axioms, which are as follows:

>**Axiom of extensionality**
>Two sets are equal if they have the same elements.

>**Axiom of regularity**
>Every non-empty set x contains a member y such that x and y are disjoint sets.

>**Axiom schema of specification**
>Subsets are commonly constructed using set builder notation. 

>**Axiom of pairing**
>If $x$ and $y$ are sets, then there exists a set which contains $x$ and $y$ as elements, for example if $x = \{1,2\}$ and $y = \{2,3\}$ then z will be $\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}$

>**Axiom of union**
>The union over the elements of a set exists. For example, the union over the elements of the set $\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}$ is $\{1,2,3\}$

>**Axiom schema of replacement**
>The axiom schema of replacement asserts that the image of a set under any definable function will also fall inside a set.

>**Axiom of infinity**
>More colloquially, there exists a set X having infinitely many members. 

>**Axiom of power set**
>The Axiom of power set states that for any set x, there is a set y that contains every subset of x.
